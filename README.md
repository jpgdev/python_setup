# Python setup scripts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpgdev/python_setup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpgdev/python_setup)

A python app to replace my current .sh setup scripts.

- It should make easier backing up manually a list of packages I want to keep through arch install and not only backing up everything.
- It should make easier setuping environment (ex. replace my current setup_vim.sh script).

**Note** : Also a little project to try out python, pip, testing etc.. with which I am not familiar enough.
